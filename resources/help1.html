<h2><strong>MapEdit - editor for PCRaster and GTiff raster maps<br /></strong></h2>
<p>Version: 3.2.1<br />Date: 20 mar 2022</p>
<h3>Loading maps</h3>
<p>Mapedit works with two map layers: the base map is a reference map which is not changed, and the top map can be edited.</p>
<p>The transparanecy of the toplayer can be adjusted, and of the Base and Edit maps the min and max displayed and the palette can be adjusted.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways to use mapedit:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you load two maps, the first one you choose is the base layer/reference map, the second one is the edit layer. If the edit layer is a GeoTiff map, it will be saved as a tif file.<br /><em>Both maps need to have the same nr. of rows, columns and cellsize</em></li>
<li>If you load only one map, this map is loaded TWICE: the base layer is seen for reference and it can also be edited. You are editintg in fact the base layer.</li>
<li>If you load maps and check the option "<em>Edit an empty layer</em>", the edit map is replaced with an empty map is created filled with the value '0' (zero) that can be edited and saved using you own name. <em>Any edits you made will be lost!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If the base map is a GeoTiff file, the edit layer will be saved as GeoTiff file with the ESPG information of the base layer, else it will be a PCRaster map file (default).</p>
<p>The legend of the base map is shown to the left of the map, the legend of the edit layer to the right.</p>
<h3>Editing options</h3>
<p>Edit shapes are selected with the tool buttons. After selecitng a shape, areas are digitized with the <em>left mouse button. Single </em>cells and rectangles have only one point (cell) or two points in opposiite corners. Lines and polygones needs to be stopped if you want to digitize a second line or polygon. You stop editing a shape by clicking with the <em>right mouse button</em>. If you then click with the left mouse button, a new shape is started.</p>
<p>Once you have digitized one or more cells or shapes, you can give the new edit value by clicking on the "v" next to the edit field. Changes are made and the digitizing is reset.</p>
<p>If you want to restire the original values, digitize one or more areas that you want to restore, close it, and click on the restire button (with tthe two round arrows).</p>
<h3>Display options</h3>
<p>The edit layer is semi-transparent on top of the base layer. The transparancy can be chgosen with the slider.</p>
<p>Both the base and edit layer can have different legend colors, click on the palette tool buttons to change the color setting of the maps and legends (def. base layer in rainbow legend and edit layer in grey scale).</p>
<p>The sliders influence the min and max display values, to better show certain areas well.</p>
<p><em>Mouse wheel</em>: zoom in and out. The reset size icon resets the zoom level to the full map.</p>
<p><em>Right Mouse button</em>: drag the map by keeping the right mouse button pressed and dragging the map.</p>
<p>good luck!</p>
